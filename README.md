# tallyUpMama
Keeping track of the money I owe my mom from Max's party, lol
<p>We agreed to split the cost, with a budget of $1,500 each
<p>Some things she paid for, some things I paid for.
<p>
<p>I want to create an app that lists and tallys what she paid for, list and tallys what I paid for, 
compares the two numbers, and produces a third number of the money that I owe my mom. 
<p>
<p>It's basically an overexaggerated calculator, lol.
