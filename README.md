# tallyUpMama
Keeping track of the money I owe my mom from Max's party, lol
We agreed to split the cost, with a budget of $1,500 each
Some things she paid for, some things I paid for.

I want to create an app that lists and tallys what she paid for, list and tallys what I paid for, 
compares the two numbers, and produces a third number of the money that I owe my mom. 

It's basically an overexaggerated calculator, lol.
